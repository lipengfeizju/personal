I am Pengfei Li, a <a href='#'>final-year CS Ph.D. candidate</a> in University of California, Riverside, under the supervision of Prof. [Shaolei Ren](https://shaoleiren.github.io/). Since the summer of 2022,
I has been working closely with [Adam Wierman](https://adamwierman.com/) at Caltech, focusing on trustworthy learning augmented online optimization. My overarching research goal is to develop **_trustworthy, equitable and sustainable_** machine learning systems that enhance the efficiency of real-world systems and address critical **_societal and environmental_** challenges.

In the summer 2023, I am fortunate to intern at Nokia Bell Labs mentored by Dr [Matthew Andrews](https://www.bell-labs.com/about/researcher-profiles/matthewandrews/), focusing on leveraging diverse IoT sensors to aid autonomous ware-house operations with enhanced dynamic photorealistic digital twins. I obtained a M.S.E degree in Laboratory for Computational Sensing and Robotics (LCSR), Johns Hopkins University, under the supervision of Prof. [Alan Yuille](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~ayuille/) and Prof. [Gregory Hager](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/hager/). Prior to joining JHU, I graduated from Zhejiang University with honors, majoring in Electrical Engineering. I was also a member of Advanced Class of Engineering Education (ACEE) in Chu Kochen Honor College (CKC).
